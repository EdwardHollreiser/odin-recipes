<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li> Tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
    <li>3-4 Large Chicken Breasts Salt</li>
    <li>Pepper</li>
    <li>2 cloves Garlic (minced)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon Thyme</li> 
    <li>teaspoon Red Pepper Flakes (may add only 1/2 teaspoon for less spice)</li>

    <li>1/2 cup Heavy Cream</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Sundried Tomatoes (chopped)</li>
    <li>1/4 - 1/2 cup Freshly Grated Parmesan Cheese</li>
    <li>Basil</li> 
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Start by heating olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Sear the chicken breasts for about 4-5 minutes per side. Season well with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Remove the chicken from the skillet and add finely diced garlic. Cook for only 1 minute since garlic can easily burn. Add thyme, red pepper flakes, chicken broth, and cream to skillet.  Cook until cream sauce begins to thicken -- about 5 minutes. Stir in sundried tomatoes.</li>
    <li>Remove from heat and add chicken to the skillet.  Spoon sauce all over the chicken.  Place in an oven set at 375 degrees and cook for 15-18 minutes to until chicken is cooked through. If using thinly sliced chicken breasts, reduce baking time.</li>
    <li>Top with fresh basil and freshly grated parmesan cheese, if so desired.</li>
</ol>
