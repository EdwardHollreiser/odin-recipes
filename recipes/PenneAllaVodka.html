<h2>Penne Alla Vodka – perfectly hearty and tender penne pasta is tossed with a creamy and vibrant, San Marzano tomato based and vodka infused sauce that’s seasoned with fresh herbs and parmesan. Talk about delicious dinner recipe!</h2>
    <p>This easy vodka sauce tastes vibrantly tomatoey, deliciously herby, lightly peppery and faintly smokey if you opt to use pancetta. And with the red pepper flakes it also has an exciting spicy little kick to it on the tip of your tongue.</p>
